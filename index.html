    <!-- How It Works -->
    <section id="how-it-works">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Orion Dev Core runs your front office in five simple steps.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Lead says hello</strong><br>
                Prospects arrive via your website, WhatsApp Business, or campaign links. Orion greets them with a friendly,
                human‑like tone—no botspeak.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Orion builds rapport and qualifies</strong><br>
                Orion chats naturally (rugby scores, local weather, simple small talk) to make people comfortable, then asks smart
                questions to qualify each lead and capture accurate details. It handles objections with empathy and keeps the
                conversation moving toward a clear next step.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Smart workflows handle the admin</strong><br>
                Behind the scenes, Orion writes to your Google Sheets, sends confirmations, and updates your systems. Each interaction
                generates structured data you can use for reporting and follow‑ups.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Calendar and payments on autopilot</strong><br>
                Orion books appointments directly into your calendar and triggers Yoco payment links for deposits or full payments,
                supporting major cards and digital wallets where available.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>You just show up</strong><br>
                By the time you meet a client, Orion has already captured their details, answered basic questions, and scheduled the meeting.
                You focus on delivering the service; Orion handles reception, admin, and follow‑through.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Powered by a multi‑AI stack</h3>
        <p>
            Behind the scenes, Orion uses a combination of Gemini (for conversational intelligence and context), Perplexity Pro (for live research
            and structured answers), and Claude Pro (for reasoning and long‑form content). This gives your office manager the equivalent of a small
            AI team working in sync.
        </p>

    <!-- Industries -->
    <section id="industries">
        <h2>Who Orion Is For</h2>
        <p>Orion Dev Core is built for service businesses where time, trust and responsiveness matter more than inventory.</p>

        <h3>Law firms and legal practices</h3>
        <p>
            Capture enquiries 24/7 from your website and WhatsApp. Pre‑qualify matters (type of case, urgency, location), and book
            consultations directly into your calendar with confirmation emails and reminders.
        </p>

        <h3>Estate agents and property professionals</h3>
        <p>
            Collect buyer and seller leads around the clock. Schedule viewings and calls, log property preferences, and send reminders.
            Use Yoco links to take deposits or booking fees securely.
        </p>

        <h3>Clinics, therapists and wellness</h3>
        <p>
            Automate new‑patient intake and key questions. Book appointments, send reminders, and reduce no‑shows while taking
            pre‑payments or deposits online.
        </p>

        <h3>Consultants, coaches and specialists</h3>
        <p>
            Filter out low‑fit leads with smart questions so only serious, qualified prospects make it onto your calendar.
            Save time on back‑and‑forth emails and manual form chasing.
        </p>

        <h3>Custom use cases</h3>
        <p>
            Have a service business that doesn't fit neatly into a box? Orion's workflows can be adapted to your intake questions,
            forms, and follow‑up process.

        <h2>About Orion Dev Core</h2>
        <p>
            Orion Dev Core is a lean, AI‑driven automation studio focused on one mission: turning your front office into a fully automated,
            professional office manager. The tagline, "AI Amplifies, I Create," reflects the philosophy: AI handles the repetitive admin
            and coordination, while humans focus on the creative, expert work only they can do.
        </p>

        <h3>Meet Orion (the AI receptionist)</h3>
        <p>
            Orion is your human‑centric lead specialist. It builds rapport like a friendly receptionist, handles objections with empathy,
            flags urgent leads, and then does the heavy lifting: generating quote references, updating sheets, sending emails, and placing
            appointments on your calendar.
        </p>

        <h3>Your AI team: Gemini, Perplexity and Claude</h3>
        <p>
            Orion Dev Core runs on a stacked AI toolkit. Gemini powers the "Orion" receptionist for natural, context‑aware conversations.
            Perplexity Pro assists with fast research and implementation details, and Claude Pro supports complex reasoning and structured
            documents. For a single subscription bundle, small businesses get the power of an AI research, admin and support team working 24/7.
